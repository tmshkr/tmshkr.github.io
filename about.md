I created this blog in order to document my adventures in code, so that others
can benefit from what I had to figure out on my own (with the help of the Internet, of course).

This blog will be updated and maintained according to my interests, which include:

* Web Development
* Mobile Development
* JavaScript
* React
* User Experience
* and more!
